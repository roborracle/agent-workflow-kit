## Understanding CLAUDE.md vs Skills

This is the most important concept to understand before building skills. Where you put instructions determines how Claude uses them.

| | CLAUDE.md | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **When loaded** | Every conversation, always | Only when invoked (via `/name` or auto-detection) |
| **What it's for** | Project-wide rules, conventions, context | Specific task workflows, specialized procedures |
| **Size concern** | Always in context, so keep it focused | Only loaded when needed, but keep under 500 lines |
| **Examples** | "Use TypeScript for all files", "Run tests before committing", API conventions | "Generate a PR summary", "Create meeting notes", "Deploy to staging" |

**Rule of thumb:** If Claude should *always* know it, put it in CLAUDE.md. If Claude should only know it when doing a specific task, make it a skill.

CLAUDE.md instructions still apply inside a skill's execution. A skill inherits your project's rules -- it doesn't override them. Think of it like layers: CLAUDE.md is the base layer, and the skill adds task-specific instructions on top.

## Frontmatter Field Reference

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended.

| Field | Required | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | No | string | directory name | Display name and `/slash-command`. Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only. Max 64 chars. |
| `description` | Recommended | string | first paragraph of content | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this for auto-invocation decisions. |
| `argument-hint` | No | string | none | Autocomplete hint for expected arguments. Shown in `/` menu. Examples: `[issue-number]`, `[filename] [format]` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | boolean | `false` | When `true`, only the user can invoke the skill. Removes it from Claude's context entirely. |
| `user-invocable` | No | boolean | `true` | When `false`, hides the skill from the `/` menu. Only Claude can invoke it. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | string (comma-separated) | all tools | Tools available without permission prompts when this skill is active. |
| `model` | No | string | inherit | Model to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or omit to inherit. |
| `context` | No | string | none | Set to `fork` to run in an isolated subagent context. |
| `agent` | No | string | `general-purpose` | Subagent type when `context: fork` is set. Options: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, or any custom agent name. |
| `hooks` | No | object | none | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this skill. See Hooks section below. |

---

## Invocation Control Matrix

How `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable` interact:

| Frontmatter | User can invoke? | Claude can invoke? | When loaded into context |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| (default -- both omitted) | Yes | Yes | Description always in context. Full skill loads when invoked. |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No | Description NOT in context. Full skill loads when user invokes. |
| `user-invocable: false` | No | Yes | Description always in context. Full skill loads when Claude invokes. |

Key nuances:
- `user-invocable` only controls `/` menu visibility, NOT the Skill tool. To block programmatic invocation, use `disable-model-invocation: true`.
- `disable-model-invocation: true` is the strongest restriction. It removes the skill from Claude's context entirely AND prevents Skill tool access.

---

## String Substitutions

Available placeholders in skill content:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments passed when invoking the skill | `/fix-issue 123` -> `$ARGUMENTS` = `123` |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]` | Specific argument by 0-based index | `$ARGUMENTS[0]` = first arg |
| `$N` | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]` | `$0` = first arg, `$1` = second |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session ID | Useful for logs, session-specific files |

**Automatic fallback:** If `$ARGUMENTS` is NOT present anywhere in the skill content, arguments are automatically appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>` at the end.

**Example with positional arguments:**

```yaml
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
argument-hint: [component] [from-framework] [to-framework]
---

Migrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```

Running `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$0` with `SearchBar`, `$1` with `React`, `$2` with `Vue`.

## Skill File Locations

Where you store a skill determines who can use it:

| Location | Path | Applies to | Priority |
|----------|------|------------|----------|
| Enterprise | Managed settings | All users in org | Highest |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | All your projects | High |
| Project | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | This project only | Medium |
| Plugin | `<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Where plugin enabled | Lowest |

When skills share the same name across levels, higher-priority locations win. Plugin skills use `plugin-name:skill-name` namespace so they cannot conflict.

**Monorepo support:** When editing files in subdirectories, Claude Code auto-discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills/` directories (e.g., `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/`).

**Additional directories:** Skills in `.claude/skills/` within `--add-dir` directories are loaded automatically with live change detection.

---

## `allowed-tools` Syntax Guide

The `allowed-tools` field restricts which tools Claude can use without permission prompts when a skill is active. Your global permission settings still apply on top of this.

**Basic syntax -- comma-separated tool names:**

```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
```

**Tool-specific patterns with globs:**

```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git *), Bash(npm test), Read
```

| Pattern | What it allows |
|---------|---------------|
| `Bash` | Any bash command (no restriction) |
| `Bash(git *)` | Any command starting with `git` |
| `Bash(npm test)` | Only the exact command `npm test` |
| `Bash(python scripts/*)` | Python on any file in `scripts/` |
| `Read` | Read any file |

**Important:** `allowed-tools` adds *additional* auto-approvals on top of your existing permission settings. It doesn't remove permissions you've already granted globally.

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Dynamic Context Injection

The `!`command`` syntax runs shell commands BEFORE the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the placeholder inline.

```yaml
---
name: pr-summary
description: Summarize changes in a pull request
context: fork
agent: Explore
allowed-tools: Bash(gh *)
---

## Pull request context
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

## Your task
Summarize this pull request...
```

When this runs:
1. Each `!`command`` executes immediately (before Claude sees anything)
2. The output replaces the placeholder
3. Claude receives the fully-rendered prompt with actual data

**Use cases:**
- Injecting git status, branch info, or diff data
- Fetching live API responses
- Reading environment variables or config files
- Getting file listings or project metadata

### Running Skills in a Subagent (context: fork)

Add `context: fork` to run a skill in an isolated subagent context. The skill content becomes the subagent's task prompt. The subagent does NOT have access to your conversation history.

**When to use `context: fork`:**
- The task is self-contained and doesn't need conversation history
- The skill produces verbose output you want to keep out of main context
- You want to enforce tool restrictions via the agent type
- The skill is computationally expensive and a cheaper model suffices

**When NOT to use `context: fork`:**
- The skill contains guidelines without a concrete task (subagent receives guidelines but no actionable prompt)
- The skill needs back-and-forth conversation with the user
- The skill needs context from the current conversation

**Agent options:**
- `Explore` -- Haiku, read-only. Best for research, file discovery, code search.
- `Plan` -- Inherits model, read-only. Best for planning research.
- `general-purpose` -- Inherits model, all tools. Best for complex multi-step tasks.
- Any custom agent name from `.claude/agents/`.

**Skills and subagents work in two directions:**

| Approach | System prompt | Task | Also loads |
|----------|---------------|------|------------|
| Skill with `context: fork` | From agent type | SKILL.md content | CLAUDE.md |
| Subagent with `skills` field | Subagent's markdown body | Claude's delegation message | Preloaded skills + CLAUDE.md |

### Supporting Files

Skills can include multiple files in their directory. Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines and move detailed reference material to separate files.

```
my-skill/
  SKILL.md              # Main instructions (required, <500 lines)
  reference.md          # Detailed docs
  scripts/
    helper.py           # Utility script
```

Reference them from SKILL.md so Claude knows they exist. Supporting files are NOT loaded automatically -- they load only when Claude needs them.

### Hooks in Skills

Skills can define lifecycle hooks in frontmatter. These hooks only run while the skill is active.

```yaml
---
name: safe-editor
description: Edit files with automatic linting
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-command.sh"
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/run-linter.sh"
---
```

**Supported hook events in skills:**

| Event | Matcher input | When it fires |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| `PreToolUse` | Tool name | Before the skill uses a tool |
| `PostToolUse` | Tool name | After the skill uses a tool |
| `Stop` | (none) | When the skill finishes (converted to SubagentStop at runtime) |

Hook commands receive JSON input via stdin with the tool context. Exit code 0 = allow, exit code 2 = block.

### Visual Output (Bundled Scripts)

Skills can bundle scripts that generate visual output (HTML, images, charts). This extends Claude's capabilities beyond text.

The skill provides orchestration instructions while the bundled script does the heavy lifting. This pattern works for dependency graphs, test coverage reports, API docs, or any visual output.

### Extended Thinking (Ultrathink)

Claude Code supports an extended thinking mode. To activate it within a skill, include the word `ultrathink` anywhere in your skill content. Its presence alone activates extended thinking for that skill's execution.

**When to use it:**
- Complex analysis requiring weighing multiple factors
- Architecture decisions with trade-offs
- Debugging tasks where root cause analysis matters

---

## Permissions and Access Control

### Restrict Claude's Skill Access

Three ways to control which skills Claude can invoke:

**1. Disable all skills** by denying the Skill tool in `/permissions`:
```
Skill
```

**2. Allow or deny specific skills** using permission rules:
```
Skill(commit)        # Allow only this skill
Skill(deploy *)      # Deny this skill (in deny rules)
```

Syntax: `Skill(name)` for exact match, `Skill(name *)` for prefix match with any arguments.

**3. Hide individual skills** by adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to their frontmatter.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not triggering

1. **Check the description** -- Does it include keywords users would naturally say?
2. **Verify it's visible** -- Ask "What skills are available?" to confirm Claude sees it.
3. **Rephrase your request** -- Try wording that more closely matches the description.
4. **Invoke directly** -- Use `/skill-name` to confirm the skill works at all.
5. **Check `disable-model-invocation`** -- If set to `true`, Claude cannot auto-invoke.

### Skill triggers too often

1. **Make the description more specific** -- Narrow the trigger conditions.
2. **Add `disable-model-invocation: true`** -- If you only want manual invocation.

### Claude doesn't see all skills

Skill descriptions are loaded into context. If you have many skills, they may exceed the character budget (2% of context window, fallback 16,000 chars total across ALL skills).

- Check: Run `/context` to see if skills are being excluded.
- Fix: Keep descriptions concise and keyword-rich. Override with `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` env var if needed.

### Subagent skill returns nothing useful

The skill probably contains guidelines without a concrete task. Subagents need an actionable prompt, not just reference material. Add explicit instructions: "Do X, then return Y."

### Arguments not being substituted

- Verify `$ARGUMENTS`, `$N`, or `$ARGUMENTS[N]` appears in the skill content.
- If none appear, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>` at the end (automatic fallback).
- Arguments are space-delimited. If an argument contains spaces, it may split unexpectedly.
